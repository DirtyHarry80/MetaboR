# MetaboR

A script based on MetaboAnalystR (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/home.xhtml) to analyse metabolomics data from targeted analysis of general metabolites. The objective is to present a condensed version with minimum necessary features, enabling the creation of standard plots (e.g. heatmap, correlation matrix, etc.). The script contains also a possibility to test for and remove outliers, based on Grubbs test and Outliers package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/outliers/outliers.pdf).

A test dataset is included based on General Metabolite analysis of HT29 cells treated with 10 mM of Metformin and corresponding negative controls. Download of raw data via the "Code" button above.

For further practical details, including protocol for sample measurement, refer to Turtoi E et al. STAR Protocols 2023.

N.B.: Installation of specific R Packages (e.g. MetaboAnalystR & Outliers) is required before using the script; See the "Libraries" section of the script.
